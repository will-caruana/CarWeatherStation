# CarWeatherStation
Using the input of from a car to be able to predict the weather
This script will use the PID 0x46 (Coolant temperature) to get temperature data from the car's ECU 7E0, and use it to predict temperature for a given pressure with the linear regression model. As before, this example is for illustration purposes, it's not guaranteed that it will work on your device, you may need to install obd library and also check compatibility with your car. Also, it is important to make sure that your vehicle supports this PID and that the OBD-II adapter is properly configured and connected to the vehicle.

The accuracy and duration of the predictions made by the model will depend on several factors such as the quality of the data used to train the model, the complexity of the model and the external factors affecting the weather like climate, topography, and human activity.

In the example I provided, the model is a simple linear regression model that only takes into account barometric pressure and temperature as input. Because of this, the model's accuracy will likely be low, especially for long-term or detailed predictions. The model can only predict the temperature for a given pressure, which is the input it was trained with. So, it can't predict the future weather conditions.

In order to make more accurate predictions, more variables and more complex models, such as neural networks, would need to be taken into account. Additionally, such models require large amounts of high-quality training data and often need to be updated frequently to maintain their accuracy.

In summary, the predictions made by the example I provided would likely only be accurate for a short period of time and would not take into account many other important factors that affect weather. To make more accurate predictions, more complex models and more data would be needed.
